# NCT Dream
Happen to be a BIG fan of the Kpop Group NCT? Do you find yourself struggling to catch up on the years of content published online about your favourite group?  We know. It is a lot to take in sometimes and we can relate. This is where YourDreamCT (Websiteâ€™s Name) comes in to be your best friend!!

From member profiles to a uniquely designed calendar that shows all upcoming NCT events, concerts and tours, YourDreamCT has all the features to keep you updated and support you in your journey in becoming the NUMBER 1 NCTzen.



## Design Process
This website is mainly for new fans of NCT Dream. From visiting the website, I hope users such as new fans will know more deeply about the group itself. Not only for new fans, there is a page where it is mainly for their schedules and when they are going for concerts, events and even world tour. Moreover, users can post questions or feedback so that only improvements will be made, not mistakes. 

In my project, I have created a few pages including:
  - Member's Profile 
    - Birthdays
    - Positions in the group (vocalist, dancer, rapper)
    - Fun Facts
    
  - Discography
    - Debut song
    - Different albums released
    - Songs released in the respective albums
    
  - Upcoming Events
    - World Tour 2023
    - Calendar
    
  - Social Media
    - Group's Instagram account
    - Member's personal Instagram account
    - Group's Youtube account
  
  - Questions/Feedback
    - For users to post questions and will answer them
    - Feedback section
 

### User Stories
#### New NCT fan that wants to catch up to NCT news & content quickly

#### Old Kpop fans who wish to come back and wants to find out about the NCT's progress in the Kpop world
 
#### Current NCT fan who wants to find out more about the upcoming concerts, tours and events.


In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.
