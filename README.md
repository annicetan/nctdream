# NCT Dream
One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Tell us about your project.
Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.



## Design Process
This website is mainly for new fans of NCT Dream. From visiting the website, I hope users such as new fans will know more deeply about the group itself. Not only for new fans, there is a page where it is mainly for their schedules and when they are going for concerts, events and even world tour. Moreover, users can post questions or feedback so that only improvements will be made, not mistakes. 

In my project, I have created a few pages including:
  - Member's Profile 
    - Birthdays
    - Positions in the group (vocalist, dancer, rapper)
    - Fun Facts
    
  - Discography
    - Debut song
    - Different albums released
    - Songs released in the respective albums
    
  - Upcoming Events
    - World Tour 2023
    - Calendar
    
  - Social Media
    - Group's Instagram account
    - Member's personal Instagram account
    - Group's Youtube account
  
  - Questions/Feedback
    - For users to post questions and will answer them
    - Feedback section
  

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

## Technologies Used
### HTML
- [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) stands for HyperText Markup Language
- It is to give descriptions and state the structre of the website
### CSS
- [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp) stands for Cascading Style Sheets
- It is to style and present to users on how the website looks like including fonts, layout and colours
### Javascript
- [Javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)
- Create content, control multimedia, animate images which means bascially programming the behaviour of the website





## Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
